# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) dashboard implemented using Next.js 15 with the App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwindcss and Shadcn UI.

## Key Technologies

- **Next.js 15 (App Router)**: Leveraging the latest features for optimal performance and developer experience.
- **React 19**: Utilizing the latest React features and hooks for efficient state management and reusuable components.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Implementing a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and consistent design.
- **Shadcn ui**: Integrating a high-quality component library for a polished and accessible user interface.

## Architecture and Design Patterns

### Component Structure

The application follows a modular component architecture, promoting reusability and maintainability:
- `public/`: Includes static assets and files. 
- `src/`: Contains all code based project files and directories.
  - `app/`: Contains the main application logic and page components.
  - `components/`: Houses reusable UI components, following the Atomic Design methodology.
  - `lib/`: Includes utility functions and custom hooks.
  - `hooks/`: Contains custom hooks for state management.

### State Management

- Utilizes React's Context API for global state management, maintaining a clean component hierarchy.
- Implements custom hooks for encapsulating, and abstracting complex logic and promoting code reuse.

### Performance Optimization

- Employs dynamic imports and code splitting to reduce initial bundle size and improve load times.
- Utilizes Next.js's Image component for optimized image loading.
- Link component for effective routing.

## Key Features

1. **User Management**:
   - CRUD operations for user accounts.
   - Dynamic role assignment and status updates.

2. **Role Management**:
   - Creation and modification of roles.
   - Real-time updates of role changes across the application.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Fully responsive layout adapting to various screen sizes and devices.
   - Utilizes Tailwind CSS for efficient responsive design implementation.

4. **Performance**:
   - Optimized rendering with React.memo and useMemo for complex components.
   - Efficient list rendering with virtualization for large datasets.

## Best Practices and Advanced Techniques

1. **Custom Hooks**: Demonstrates the use of custom hooks for shared logic, such as data fetching and form handling.

2. **Error Boundaries**: Implements React Error Boundaries for graceful error handling and improved user experience.

3. **Render Props Pattern**: Utilizes the render props pattern for highly reusable and flexible components.

4. **Compound Components**: Implements the compound components pattern for creating intuitive and flexible component APIs.

5. **Advanced TypeScript**: Uses advanced TypeScript features like conditional types, mapped types, and generics for type-safe component props and state.
